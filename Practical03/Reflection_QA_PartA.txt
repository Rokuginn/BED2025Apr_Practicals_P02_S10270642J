### Reflection:

During Part A: Lab Activity, I learned the importance of separating database logic from route handlers to improve code readability and maintainability.
When all logic is embedded directly in the route handlers, it becomes harder to understand and debug, especially as the application grows.
If a bug were to occur in how books are created in the database,
having the database logic in separate functions would make it significantly easier to isolate and fix the issue. One challenge I faced was ensuring proper error handling and managing database connections efficiently to avoid resource leaks.
